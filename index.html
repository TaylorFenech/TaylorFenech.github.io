								<p>Hi, My name is Taylor Fenech and I am a student who is studying a Bachelor of Education/Bachelor of design innovation. I completed my education in the Wollongong diocese. The primary school that I attended from kindergarten to Year 6 was St Clare’s in Narellan Vale and the high school I attended from Year 7 to Year 12 was Magdalene Catholic high school in Smeaton Grange. I enjoyed subjects that were hands on, this included Industrial Timber, Food technology, Textiles and PDH/PE. I enjoy subjects that are hands on, as I am a person who loves being active and doesn’t like sitting down in a classroom. I enjoy working with children and that is why I have chosen this profession. I have completed three placements and learnt many skills to manage behaviour, how to work with different learners, time management and many more skills. The projects that the students were working on whilst I have been on placements has been a footstool, bedside table, pencil box, wooden puzzle and a clock. Each project differed in how content was delivered and tested my knowledge and practical skills to demonstrate and explain processes to the students.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Projects</h2>
								<p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Footstool</p>
								<p>I completed this footstool as part of a unit for Industrial Timber at University. It took roughly 4-5 weeks to design and construct.</p>
								<p>Feature 1 - Partaking in this footstool construction, it tested my skills with joinery, upholstery, and a quality finish. I designed this footstool to suit existing furniture that is within my house.</p>
								<p>Feature 2 - A key feature within this footstool is the pattern that is on the fabric. I designed this fabric and chose to use blue as it is my favourite colour.</p>
								<p>Feature 3 - The thickness of the timber is quite thin; this was done so that the footstool didn’t look bulky.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/341719277_237204648980613_123307890553637133_n.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Heirloom box</p>
								<p>Another project that I completed was an heirloom box. I designed and constructed a jewellery box for my niece.</p>
								<p>Feature 1 - The dowel keys that are on the side of the jewellery box add a hidden feature that shows end grain but also strengthens the joint.</p>
								<p>Feature 2 - The divides inside the jewellery box were a key feature to keep jewellery sorted and untangled.</p>
								<p>Feature 3 - The engraving of my niece's name on the top of the jewellery box adds a personal touch.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/346150689_790228939476603_2577139567729917053_n.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								
								<p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Modular Coffee Table</p>
								<p>For my major work for Uni, I have decided to design and construct a modular coffee table. This coffee table will be able to be used as a coffee table table, board game table, lego table, puzzle table and much more.</p>
								<p>Feature 1 - The first feature is just an ordinary coffee table with storage elements such a 2 drawers and a bottom shelf.</p>
								<p>Feature 2 - The second feature is the internal box, the table top can be removed and the internal box can be used to play board games, build puzzles and lego. It also has magnetic stripping around the coffee table to put board game trays, card trays and a cup holder.</p>
								<p>Feature 3 - The last feature is the table top can be flipped upside down and a lego table top is on the underside. It has slots and engraving on it to sort out different sized lego pieces.</p>

<article id="Pedagogy">
    <h2 class="major">Pedagogy</h2>
    <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
    <p>As a student studying to become an educator, I believe that teaching is not just the transfer of knowledge but an interactive processes that engages students in active learning. My pedagogy is that every student has the potentional to excel and that it is my responsibility to create an environment where this potential can be realised. I believe that education can transform lives and I am passionate about educating and mentoring others. My pedagogy is centered around adapting a growth mindset, encouraging curiosity and making learning accessible to everyone.

		In my teaching, I focus on the following principles:
		<p>	Student centered learning: Learning should be student centered. I strive to create to create a classroom environment that is inclusive, supportive and responsive to the diverse needs of my students. This means differentiating instruction to accommodate varying learning styles, interests and abilities, and fostering a classroom culture where every student feels valued and empowered to participate.</p>
		<p>	Active engagement: I am committed to making learning an active process. I aim to incorporate hands-on activities, collaborative projects, and real-world problem-solving tasks into my lessons to ensure that students are not just passive recipients of information but active participants in their own learning journey. I believe that students learn best when they are engaged, challenged, and given opportunities to apply what they have learned in meaningful ways.</p>
		<p>	Technology Engagement: I recognise the importance of integrating technology into the classroom to enhance learning. I aim to use various digital tools and platforms to create interactive and engaging learning experiences. Whether through online collaborative projects, digital simulations, or multimedia presentations</p>
		<p>	Through my experiences on placement as an educator, I have developed a deep appreciation for the impact that effective teaching can have on students' lives. I am committed to continuing to learn and grow as an educator, and sharing my knowledge and passion for technology with others.</p>

		<p> A quote from Winnie the Pooh has always stood out to me. You're braver than you believe, And stronger than you seem, And smarter than you think. This quote has always stood out to me, as a teacher it is important to believe in your students and ensure they believe in themselves.</p>

<!-- Classroom Management -->
<article id="ClassroomManagement">
    <h2 class="major">Classroom Management</h2>
    <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>
    <p>Effective classroom management is essential for creating a productive learning environment. Here are some strategies to help you manage your classroom effectively:
		<p>	1. Establish Clear Expectations:
			At the beginning of the semester, I will establish clear, concise rules that align with school policies. Discuss them with students to ensure understanding. Be consistent in enforcing rules and expectations. This helps build trust and predictability in the classroom.
			</p>
		<p>	2. Build Positive Relationships: Learn about your students’ interests, strengths, and challenges. Building rapport helps in understanding and addressing their needs. Encourage positive behavior by acknowledging and rewarding good conduct. This could be through verbal praise, stickers, or a points system.</p>
		<p>	3. Develop Engaging Lessons: Incorporate activities that require student participation, such as group work, discussions, and hands-on projects. Engaged students are less likely to be disruptive. Cater to diverse learning styles and abilities by offering various types of activities and assignments. This keeps students interested and challenged.</p>
